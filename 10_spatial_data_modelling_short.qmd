# Spatial Data Modelling

How do we -- as humans -- perceive the world, and form cognitive models of reality?

::: {.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
## Learning Objectives {background-color="lightPink"}

-   Discuss how humans perceive and conceptualise the world;
-   Appreciate the role of distance and scale for the analysis and representation of spatial phenomena;
-   Reflect on the need to represent spatio-temporal data in information systems;
-   Discuss how we operationalise these conceptual models of the physical world into information systems.

## World conceptualisations

People manipulate *objects* but cultivate *fields* @couclelis2005people

@kuhn2012core introduced the *Core concepts of Spatial Information* that goes beyond object and field (but hold on, under construction).

## Exercise: Look out of the window {.unnumbered}
::: {.incremental}
-   What *things* did you name?
-   Did you describe *where* things are, what *properties* they have?
-   Did you note something about the World that was not a *thing*?
-   Did you reflect on anything in the environment that *changes* in time?

## Fields

Continuous scalar- or vector-valued phenomena that have a value definable for any location within the entire domain space.

![Wind and temperature](./figs/1_part/10_spatial_data_modeling/windy_field.png){width="70%," layout="center"}

**Answer to**: What is the value of a phenomenon *here?*

## Objects

- Discrete entities that populate space, but do not fill it;
- Preserve their identity and can be manipulated 
- Are bounded, but the boundary is not necessarily *known*
-   They can be made-up (*fiat*, based on thought) or *bona-fide* (genuine).
    -   Victoria (spatial political entity) vs Tasmania (island)

## Objects vs Fields

::: callout-tip
## Exercise: Modelling choices

-   What would you model as a field, and what as an object?
-   What kind of objects are these?

## Places

- Places are particular *types* of objects;
- They are locations enriched with meaning, by people, for people.
- A significant part of working with geospatial data, as we *refer* to places when we communicate!
- Often refered to by function (*home*), or toponym (place name) (*Naarm*, *Melbourne*).

**Answer to**: *Where am I?*

## Networks and Events

- **Networks**:  answer questions about connectivity. Emerge from relationships between objects.
    - *A power cable has been interrupted leading to an outage of electricity supply...*
- **Events:**  Answer questions about change in locations, neighbourhoods, values of the above concepts. 
    - *Flooding occured in Melbourne yesterday...*

## Spatial relationships

Give rise to networks. Things relate in space in many ways, not only by *distance*.

-   Qualitative spatial relationships: *near*, *nearer then*, *to the West of*, *touch*, *overlap*, *connecting to, between*

-   Binary vs n-ary: the above are all binary ( between two objects), except *connecting to* and *between*.

## Distance

**Tobler's first law:** *"Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things."* @tobler1970computer

## Exercise: Describe patterns you see

How does distance alter what you expect to see/encounter?

## More Geography principles

- **Corollary to the First law:** Spatial heterogeneity (Things are *not* the same everywhere)
- **Tobler's second law:** *"the phenomenon external to a geographic area of interest affects what goes on inside."*
- **Granularity/Precision:** The level of detail at which we represent a phenomenon alters the occlusions we can draw about the phenomenon. Closely relates to *scale* of analysis.
- **Accuracy**: Pertains to *correctness* of a value (attribute, position);
- **Provenance**: How (and when) the data came to be ( how they were collected, processed, used)

## Further impacts on data handling

- Boundaries of the area described by the data / map;
- The Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP)

::: callout-tip
## Exercise: How do the principles above apply here?

Discuss with neighbour how the boundary problem and scale may influence what we see.

## Exercise: What do you know about spatial information systems?

Discuss in groups what data a public transport system may use, and what analyses it may support.

-   What data would you store?
-   What spatio-temporal data would you store?
-   What analyses do these data enable?
-   How would you store such information?
