# Ethical and Socially Responsible Data Management

As engineers, we yield great power to change the world. We are responsible for the consequences of our design decisions and the impact the implementation of our designs will have on the world.

## Learning objectives {background-color="lightPink"}
- Understand the concept of *social responsibility*;
- Reflect on the different communities impacted by our design decisions;
- Be able to critically evaluate the inclusiveness and ethics of your design and design process;
- Apply this thinking to your requirement gathering process.

## Representativeness of data and systems

:::{.incremental}
Data we analyse **may not be** *representative* of the population we **believe** we analyse;

Systems we develop may not *serve* the population we **should** serve

We may cause **harm** by neglecting to understand the representativeness of data/systems.

## Recap {background-color="lightPink"}

1. You have gained an appreciation for the complexities of requirements analysis;
2. You appreciate the role that different sources of information can complement each other to identify project requirements;
3. You have thought about particular spatial requirements that an information system or database may need to support.
4. You now have tools at your disposal to undertake requirements analysis (see [Practical](/practicals/03_requirements_conceptual.qmd) )
