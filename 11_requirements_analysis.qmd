# [L2a] Requirements Analysis

Requirements analysis is a structured process of distilling what *matters* in a project and separating it from what is *not necessary*.

## Learning objectives {background-color="lightPink"}
- Appreciate the complexity of gathering information system requirements;
- Understand the impact of scope creep;
- Reflect on the varieties of spatial information/data, and therefore *spatial* requirements
- Undertake requirements analysis based on a document.

## Exercise: Draw a sketch of a plane {.unnumbered}

Draw as faithfully as you can.

Compare your sketch with your colleagues. Discuss the similarities and differences you see. Besides artistic skills, what could have caused these?

*Note:* keep your drawings, we may get back to them!

## Requirements analysis

### What is involved?^[Adapted from: [https://www.smartsheet.com/content/requirements-analysis](https://www.smartsheet.com/content/requirements-analysis)]

:::{.incremental}

- **Business Requirements:** high-level (company/project) requirements that map to business objectives. Understand what the project/business *aims* to accomplish, how they may plan to develop (expand scope) in the future, and what is *not* within scope. Includes specification of constraints;
- **Customer Requirements:** Product expectations of a specific user group -- understand *who* will be using the system, understand their *workflows* and particular *pain* points. If possible, interact with all targeted user types;
- **Social Responsibility:** Product expectations of people that are covered by the data (possibly geographically) -- understand *who* will be captured by the data, and who's knowledge, lifes and needs the data portray, and whether this is done with their awareness and consent.
- **Design Requirements:** capture design features based on customer and product requirements -- *what actions* will the system have to support, how will the users *access* the system, do they have any particular *accessibility needs*?;
- **Functional Requirements:** product requirements describing the *service* that a system *must deliver* based on specific *behaviors* of features and *functions*;
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** general qualities of a solution, such as a *performance expectations* (e.g., uptime guarantees). 

:::

Requirements are summarised in a **Product/Service Requirements Document** that captures the purpose, characteristics, functions, and features of a product.

This is a foundation for the next steps - conceptual development and implementation.

- ![Documentation](./figs/1_part/11_requirements_analysis/document.png) Documentation, incl regulations, specifications, standards, operating procedures, contracts;

- ![Users](./figs/1_part/11_requirements_analysis/user.png) User interviews and focus groups with different user types;

- ![User observation](./figs/1_part/11_requirements_analysis/user_observation.png) Observation of user interaction with existing systems, incl. log analysis, eye tracking, shadowing

#### Requirements from documentation

System requirements are often *implicitly* specified in documentation. 

They are usually not explicitly targeted at a particular information system, but *can* be used to capture the main requirements of the system.

::: {.content-hidden when-format="revealjs"}
These documents contain rich information about system requirements:

- Laws and Regulations
- Standards (ISO, OpenGeospatialConsortium, IEEE)
- Standard Operating Procedures, training materials

## Activity: Examples of spatial requirements

Can you give examples of codified rules that have a **spatial** component?

Discuss the spatial components of your example with a colleague. Which of those may need to be implemented in a spatially-enabled information system?

### Spatial requirements

Many domains have requirements with respect to the **spatial** and **spatio-temporal properties** of a system and its components.

These may include specifications for the required:

- spatial properties of *things* (e.g., the size of a regulation AFL or soccer pitch or size of a parking lot);
- the requirements on the *determination* of these spatial properties (e.g., the accuracy of measuring a land ownership boundary);
- or how *things* interact/relate (e.g., the minimal distance between a road and a house, or speed on a freeway).

Sometimes these requirements are specified vaguely (*near*, *slow*, *next to*)

## Spatial data vs spatial information

- **Data**: records of observations, measurements, or registrations. Results of a data capature process.
- **Spatial data**: records of **location** (located extent) and **time** linked with other attributes. For interpretability, locations are recorded as **position data**, grounded in a **spatial reference system**.
- **Information**: data interpreted for a specific decision process or information need (= purpose).
- **Spatial information**: selects, aggregates, and interprets spatial data to answer **where** questions (and possibly when, what, how as a consequence).

### Location and Position

- **Location**: the "footprint" of a *thing* in space and time (*locus*)
- **Position**: the identifiable location of a *thing* given with respect to something else - establishing a **reference system**.

Examples:

- Named location -- Place name (*My home*, *here*, *Melbourne*)
- Relative position (*bearing: 36 deg, distance: 37.5m from **here**)
- Qualitative and relative to a named location (*North of the Yarra river*)
- Named (identifiable) location in a partition of space (*Postcode: 3010*)
- Quantitative, shared origin, along a 1D feature -- Linear Referencing system (56km of Monash FWY [from Melbourne GPO])
- Position in a 2+D coordinate system (*lon: 144.960, lat: -37.799 in WGS84*)
- Named in a hierarchical system (*700 Swantson St, Parkville 3010, VIC*)
- Position in a trajectory (*[07/03/2023,144.960,-37.799],[08/03/2023,0,0]*)

### Spatial scale

Often, you see the term **Geographical information**. This is purely a question of scale [@montello2005scale] .

![Spatial scales](/figs/1_part/11_requirements_analysis/scale.png)

## Issues in requirements analysis

### Hard and Soft requirements

- **Hard**: the requirements **must** always be met;
- **Soft**: the requirements **should** be met whenever possible, or as much as possible (or practicable).

**BUT**

- requirements may still be **ambiguous**
- requirements may still be **vague**

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
A nice treatise of uncertainty applied to spatial *objects* is in [@fisher99models], but can be extended to functions and processes. For well defined objects, we deal with *probabilistic* uncertainty in their location. For poorly defined objects, we distinguish between *vagueness* ( when the definition of the class of an object is poor). In contrast, object class *ambiguity* refers to confusion over the definition of the class, that may be undistinguishabel from another. Ambiguity has two ways of manifestation: (1) when an object is well defined, but may be a member of two classes, wee talk of class definition *discord*. This happens often when fusing datasets with different classifications; in contrast to (2) non-specificity, where the classification of an object to a classs is subject to interpretation.

### Scope creep

**Scope creep:** *When a project's completion requirements uncontrollably exceed planned requirements.*

**Effects of scope creep:**

:::{.incremental}
- Project runs out of time;
- System is too complex/resource intensive/maintenance intensive;
- System runs out of budget

### Project Management strategies

Requirements analysis is also the start of the project management lifecycle. 

There are many approaches to project management. We will mention two. 

That said -- there are variants, and each project develops some modifications to their own approach.

- **Waterfall:** a (traditional) top down planning process, with steps:

![Waterfall project management](/figs/1_part/11_requirements_analysis/waterfall.png)

- **Agile:** an approach acknowledging changes in requirements are inevitable, attempting to deliver a minimum-working product with the majority of important properties/functions of the project at regular iterations. As such, it breaks the waterfall to a series of small, manageable waterfalls executed over a short period of time (sprint, say 2 weeks)

## Recap {background-color="lightPink"}

1. You have gained an appreciation for the complexities of requirements analysis;
2. You appreciate the role that different sources of information can complement each other to identify project requirements;
3. You have thought about particular spatial requirements that an information system or database may need to support.
4. You now have tools at your disposal to undertake requirements analysis (see [Practical](/practicals/03_requirements_conceptual.qmd) )
