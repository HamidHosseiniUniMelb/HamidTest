# [L4b] Physical DB Design

The last step in the DB design process.

## Physical DB design process

::: {.incremental}
+ The creation of data structures and filling of *data* into a *specific* *instance* of a database of a *given* type and implemented on a given (file) *system*;
	- Creation of the database schema and table schemas, 
	- Definition of constraints 
	- Insertion of the data into the tables;
- Optimizing the data organisation (on disk(s)) and access to enhance performance or ease of interaction;
	- Creation of indexes and fine-tuning DB properties
	- Creation of views
- Using the CREATE/UPDATE/DROP statements, possibly system specific dialect of SQL;

## Schemas: terminology

- In PostgreSQL:
	- server instance == db *cluster*, running on a *host* computer
	- database == catalog == single database (postgres is a default)
	- schema == *namespace* within database, logically grouping content (*tables*). 
	- user == named account, who can connect to database, own and use objects. Usually associated with a schema	
	
	```
	database_name.schema_name.object_name
	```

- In Oracle:
	- server instance == database == catalog 
	- schema == namespace within database, identical to user account
	- user ~ schema ~ named account*. But can use objects in other schemas
	
	```
	schema_name.object_name
	```

- In MySQL:
	- server instance == set of databases
	- database == catalog == a namespace within the server.
	- schema == not used 
	- user == named account, who can connect to server and objects in one or more databases. 
	
	```
	database_name.object_name
	```

## Recap {background-color="lightPink"}

- You understand how the logical structure of the database requires to be further modified in the physical design steps to lead to a usable database.
- You appreciate why this is tightly coupled to the speciifc database management system used.
