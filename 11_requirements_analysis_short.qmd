# Requirements Analysis

Requirements analysis is a structured process of distilling what *matters* in a project and separating it from what is *not necessary*.

## Learning objectives {background-color="lightPink"}
- Appreciate the complexity of gathering information system requirements;
- Understand the impact of scope creep;
- Reflect on the varieties of spatial information/data, and therefore *spatial* requirements
- Undertake requirements analysis based on a document.

## Exercise: Draw a sketch of a plane {.unnumbered}

Draw as faithfully as you can.

Compare your sketch with your colleagues. Discuss the similarities and differences you see. Besides artistic skills, what could have caused these?

*Note:* keep your drawings, we may get back to them!

## Requirements analysis - scope^[Adapted from: [https://www.smartsheet.com/content/requirements-analysis](https://www.smartsheet.com/content/requirements-analysis)]

:::{.incremental}

- **Business Requirements:** high-level (company/project) requirements that map to business objectives. Project/business *aims*, visions of future scope, and what is *not* within scope. Includes constraints;
- **Customer Requirements:** Understand *who* will be using the system and how. If possible, interact with all targeted user types;
- **Social Responsibility:** Product expectations of people that are covered by the data (possibly geographically), and whether this is done wih their awareness and consent.

## Requirements analysis - scope (cont.)

:::{.incremental}

- **Design Requirements:** capture design features based on customer and product requirements;
- **Functional Requirements:**  *service* that a system *must deliver* based on specific *behaviors* of features and *functions*; 
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** *performance expectations* (e.g., uptime guarantees).

## Spatial requirements

Requirements with respect to the **spatial** and **spatio-temporal properties** of a system.

These may include:

- spatial properties of *things*;
- the requirements on the *determination* (e.g., measurement accuracy) of these spatial properties;
- or how *things* interact/relate.

Sometimes these requirements are specified vaguely (*near*, *slow*, *next to*)

## Exercise: Spatial requirements {.unnumbered}

Think about spatial requirements for the following systems:

- [Traffic - Road rules](https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/safety-and-road-rules/road-rules)
- [Electrical infrastructure - safely working around power lines](https://esv.vic.gov.au/technical-information/electrical-installations-and-infrastructure/no-go-zones/)
- [Mobile network coverage](https://amta.org.au/coverage-questions/)
- [Street trees and nature strip vegetation](https://www.victoriawalks.org.au/trees/)

Select **one** of these topics. Discuss with your neighbour to think of one **spatial** requirement under each of the following types:

- quantitative (numeric, precise in nature)
- qualitative (specified using words, may be vague)
- a property of a single thing
- a relationship between two (or more) things

## Location and Position

- **Location**: the "footprint" of a *thing* in space and time (*locus*)
- **Position**: the identifiable location of a *thing* given with respect to something else - establishing a **reference system**.

## Location and Position
:::{.incremental}
- Named location -- Place name (*My home*, *here*, *Melbourne*)
- Relative position (*bearing: 36 deg, distance: 37.5m from **here**)
- Qualitative and relative to a named location (*North of the Yarra river*)
- Named (identifiable) location in a partition of space (*Postcode: 3010*)
- Quantitative, shared origin, along a 1D feature -- Linear Referencing system (56km of Monash FWY [from Melbourne GPO])
- Position in a 2+D coordinate system (*lon: 144.960, lat: -37.799 in WGS84*)
- Named in a hierarchical system (*700 Swantson St, Parkville 3010, VIC*)
- Position in a trajectory (*[07/03/2023,144.960,-37.799],[08/03/2023,0,0]*)

## Spatial scale

Often, you see the term **Geographical information**. This is purely a question of scale [@montello2005scale] .

![Spatial scales](/figs/1_part/11_requirements_analysis/scale.png)

## Hard and Soft requirements

- **Hard**: the requirements **must** always be met;
- **Soft**: the requirements **should** be met whenever possible, or as much as possible (or practicable).

**BUT**

- requirements may still be **ambiguous**
- requirements may still be **vague**

## Exercise: CASA - Drone Rules

Identify spatial and non-spatial requirements. Are these hard or soft / vague or ambiguous requirements?
