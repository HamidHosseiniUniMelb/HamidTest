# Data Cleaning

**Probabilistic databases – handling uncertainty**

- Think of sensor networks – probability that something is what it reports
- Uncertain values (inputs)
    - Attribute uncertainty (temperature +-.5 deg C, position uncertainty)
    - Correlated uncertainty: correlation of x and y in geo coordinates

- A probabilistic database considers a discrete probability distribution of all possible Worlds.
- A relational database explicitly models only one of such worlds.
- The probability of all the worlds sums to 1.

**Research challenges (of interest to us)**

- *Self-Healing Maps: ML in databases for error detection and rectification, incl. outlier detection
- *Place databases – Graph databases (Property graphs) and spatial operations/indexes and semantic reasoning
- High performance mobile object analytics with MObj databases (incl mapmatching, characterization, viz and analytics)
- HD maps: database support for high definition maps (autonomous vehicles), db updating
- LIDAR/Point cloud data structures and octrees

**Summary: Advances in DB**

- Large-scale data processing and complex deployments need different solutions
- Partitioning of databases
- Network communiction is not instantaneous
- CAP
- Other types of data sotrage: key-value pairs, documents, graphs,... Suit different applications
- Some non-traditional databases have great potential in spatial applciations (array DBs, graph DBs, Document stores, probabilistic DBs)
