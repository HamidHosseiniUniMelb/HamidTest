# [A6] Data Management Project â€“ report and database realisation

Realisation of the spatial database previously designed in the project design proposal. 

The report should recapitulate the main aims of the project, the approach taken by the team, link main requirements to the capabilities of the implemented database system and its interaction with a GIS client, if appropriate. If an interaction with the GIS client is considered, the visualisations used should be of cartographically sound quality, with consistent use of cartographic symbology appropriate to the use case (see project [resources](./project_resources.qmd)). 

The report should provide a documentation of the final logical design used, discuss technical choices of note in the final realisation, outline how the database was populated with appropriate (possibly made up) data, and demonstrate that the database system is able to adequately support the analytical requirements noted in the design brief [project_specification](project_specification.qmd).

Do not forget to explicitly address ethical considerations, including data access and use, and data sovereignty. 

This is a group assessment. The deliverables are: a report of a maximum of 15 pages (per group) (35 points), the realised implementation passing acceptance criteria, and a 1-page reflection per individual student (10 points). Check submission instructions at the end of this page.

This assessment should require about 50 hours to complete.


## Assignment report components

- **Documentation: from requirements to implementation [7 pts]:**  The documentation of the mapping from requirements to implementation, with supporting arguments for technical choices. Documentation of what requirements have been met, which have been supplemented by designer's choices (and why), or not satisfied by the implementation (possibly because it is not possible to satisfy them for computational or technical reasons). 
- **Documentation: technical aspects [7 pts]:** Documentation of the final implemented logical model, and discussion of the choices made to deal with database performance, integrity management during updates of the data;
- **Documentation: functionality/analytical capabilities [7 pts]:** Documentation of the implemented analytical and data management capabilities based on the identified requirements, with demonstration queries and query results, where applicable. The implementation is based on sound technically and conceptual use of the DBMS, incl custom functionality where suitable;
- **Demonstration SQL code [5 pts]:** professionally formatted, seamlessly executable code with inline documentation to demonstrate the analytical capabilities of the realised database, including, where applicable, sample insert or update queries demonstrating the data management capabilities based on simple sample inputs.
- **Data sources and data ingestion and processing [5 pts]:** Annotated and referenced sources of data used, incl. the rational for why they were chosen. Documentation of the data processing and ingestion pipeline with characterisation of the final storage structures for all data used.
- **Report presentation [4 pts]:** professional-level formatting, structure, grammar and writing style, illustration with diligently cross-referenced figures with meaningful captions, and proper citations/referencing. 

## Individual reflection components

+ **Individual reflection [10 pts]:** a professional-level, brief and to the point reflection structured along the aspects of (a) Situation, (b) Approach taken to address the situation, and (c) Outcome, for :
 - A **Technical challenge** you encountered, across the entire project;
 - A **Spatial challenge** you encountered, specifically relating to a problem with thinking about the spatial requirements, conceptual modeling of spatial aspects of the project, or relating to the data envisaged;
 - An **Interpersonal/teamwork challenge** reflecting on your role in the team and contribution, team dynamics and collaboration management, possibly including your own or the team's individual strengths and weaknesses. 

Note: A reflection should be honest, deep, personal, and beyond a single, technical issue. A reflection on your personal working style, abilities, and qualities is key to grow as a scientist and engineer. Also check the module on Canvas with links to University resources about reflections.

The visual aids such as diagrams, tables and maps to support the text are lacking in a number of places where their use would be appropriate.  The level of graphical presentation is insufficient, and not undertaken with care. The attribution of external sources and references has more significant flaws, *even if* it is still possible to (after effort) identify the referenced document. The report is accompanied by an SQL file only somewhat identifying queries that realise some of the requirements of the project, but not all.	|

The assessment of the individual reflection will be assessed based on the following rubric (**10 pts total**):

|     Criteria    	|     Outstanding (8 to   10 pts)    	|     Deep, broad and critical reflection (6 to 8 pts)    	|     Balanced reflection (4 to 6   pts)    	|     Descriptive but shallow (2 to 4 pts)    	|     Weak (<=2 pts)    	|
|---	|---	|---	|---	|---	|---	|
|     **Individual   Reflection**    	|     Highly reflective   response. Demonstrates the ability to critically consider and assess own contributions to the project by reflecting on challenges, reflecting on strategies that enabled to resolve them, and the outcomes achieved, including learning for the future incl. self-development.    	|     Reflective   response. Considers and attempts to assess challenges, approaches taken and results achieved.   	|     Somewhat reflective response. Tends to describe rather than reflect on challenge, the reflection on the appraoch taken is somewhat shallow and it is not clear how the outcomes inform change in future behaviour.   	|     A reflection on individual challenge during the undertaking of the task is not evident, and the outcomes and not supported by sufficient ellaboration on the approach taken. Little to not reflection on learnings for the future. 	|     A reflection on  the challenges, approaches and outcomes along the three kinds of challenges is missing or incomplete. The description of individual learning/growth is either unconvincing or lacking.    	|

## Submission guidelines

1. Submit into Assignment 6.1 on Canvas:
    - A **report** of a maximum of 15 pages per group (exclusive of appendices for the final Logical ER diagram and data dictionary/specification of the implemented system) (35 pts total)
    - A first **SQL file** documenting your **database setup (data creation and insertion)** processes in the form of SQL commands. For data import processes that were done using non-SQL functionalities (e.g. QGIS or command line tools, Python scripts), describe these processes in SQL comments (lines beginning with `--`). The markers will not execute this SQL file but will look over it as part of the assessment process;
    - A second **SQL file** with the SQL `INSERT` or `SELECT` statements that **demonstrate the requested functionality**, both ones that run, as well as those that need to fail by design. These queries should be able to be executed on Wammawatcha by the markers. Clear and extensive commenting is expected.
2. A separate submission (Assignment 6.2 in Canvas) of **a 1-page self-reflection** *per individual student* (10 pts).
